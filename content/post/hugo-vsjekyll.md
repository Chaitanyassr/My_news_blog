## hugo vs jekyll

# hugo vs Jekyll: What are the differences?

Developers describe Hugo as "A Fast and Flexible Static Site Generator built with love by spf13 in GoLang". Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. It is optimized for speed, easy use and configurability. Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full html website. Hugo makes use of markdown files with front matter for meta data. On the other hand, Jekyll is detailed as "Blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby". Think of Jekyll as a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

Hugo and Jekyll belong to "Static Site Generators" category of the tech stack.

Some of the features offered by Hugo are:

Run Anywhere - Hugo is quite possibly the easiest to install software you've ever used, simply download and run. Hugo doesn't depend on administrative privileges, databases, runtimes, interpreters or external libraries. Sites built with Hugo can be deployed on S3, Github Pages, Dropbox or any web host.
Fast & Powerful - Hugo is written for speed and performance. Great care has been taken to ensure that Hugo build time is as short as possible. We're talking milliseconds to build your entire site for most setups.
Flexible - Hugo is designed to work how you do. Organize your content however you want with any URL structure. Declare your own content types. Define your own meta data in YAML, TOML or JSON.
On the other hand, Jekyll provides the following key features:

Simple - No more databases, comment moderation, or pesky updates to installâ€”just your content.
Static - Markdown (or Textile), Liquid, HTML & CSS go in. Static sites come out ready for deployment.
Blog-aware - Permalinks, categories, pages, posts, and custom layouts are all first-class citizens here.
"Lightning fast" is the top reason why over 35 developers like Hugo, while over 65 developers mention "Github pages integration" as the leading cause for choosing Jekyll.

Hugo and Jekyll are both open source tools. It seems that Jekyll with 38K GitHub stars and 8.28K forks on GitHub has more adoption than Hugo with 36K GitHub stars and 4.05K GitHub forks.

According to the StackShare community, Jekyll has a broader approval, being mentioned in 110 company stacks & 123 developers stacks; compared to Hugo, which is listed in 36 company stacks and 60 developer stacks.
